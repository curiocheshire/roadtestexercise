    <h3>Misery by Maroon 5</h3>
    <p>
        Oh-yeah
        Oh-yeah
        So scared of breaking it
        That you won't let it bend
        And I wrote two hundred letters
        I will never send
        Sometimes these cuts
        Are so much deeper then they seem
        You'd rather cover up
        I'd rather let them bleed
        So let me be
        And I'll set you free, oh-yeah
        I am in misery
        There ain't nobody
        Who can comfort me, oh-yeah
        Why won't you answer me?
        The silence is slowly killing me, oh-yeah
        Girl you really got me bad
        You really got me bad
        Now I'm gonna get you back
        I'm gonna get you back
        Your salty skin and how
        It mixes in with mine
        The way it feels to be
        Completely intertwined
        Not that I didn't care
        It's that I didn't know
        It's not what I didn't feel
        It's what I didn't show
        So let me be and I'll set you free
        I am in misery
        There ain't nobody
        Who can comfort me, oh-yeah
        Why won't you answer me?
        The silence is slowly killing me, oh-yeah
        Girl you really got me bad
        You really got me bad
        Now I'm gonna get you back
        Now I'm gonna get you back, yeah
        You say your faith is shaken
        And you may be mistaken
        You keep me wide awake
        And waiting for the sun
        I'm desperate and confused
        So far away from you
        And I'm getting near
        I don't care where I have to run
        Why do you do
        What you do to me, yeah
        Why won't you answer me
        Answer me, yeah
        Why do you do
        What you do to me, yeah
        Why won't you answer me
        Answer me, yeah
        I am in misery
        There ain't nobody
        Who can comfort me, oh-yeah
        Why won't you answer me?
        The silence is slowly killing me, oh-yeah
        Girl you really got me bad
        You really got me bad
        Now I'm gonna get you back
        Now I'm gonna get you back
        Girl you really got me bad
        You really got me bad
        Now I'm gonna get you back
        I'm gonna get you back
        Girl you really got me bad
        You really got me bad
        Now I'm gonna get you back
        I'm gonna get you back
        Girl you really got me bad
        You really got me bad
        Now I'm gonna get you back
        I'm gonna get you back
