    <h3>Misery by Maroon 5</h3>
    <p>
        Oh-yeah <br>
        Oh-yeah <br>
        So scared of breaking it <br>
        That you won't let it bend <br>
        And I wrote two hundred letters <br>
        I will never send <br>
        Sometimes these cuts <br>
        Are so much deeper then they seem <br>
        You'd rather cover up <br>
        I'd rather let them bleed <br>
        So let me be <br>
        And I'll set you free, oh-yeah <br>
        I am in misery <br>
        There ain't nobody <br>
        Who can comfort me, oh-yeah <br>
        Why won't you answer me? <br>
        The silence is slowly killing me, oh-yeah <br>
        Girl you really got me bad <br>
        You really got me bad <br>
        Now I'm gonna get you back <br>
        I'm gonna get you back <br>
        Your salty skin and how <br>
        It mixes in with mine <br>
        The way it feels to be <br>
        Completely intertwined <br>
        Not that I didn't care <br>
        It's that I didn't know <br>
        It's not what I didn't feel <br>
        It's what I didn't show <br>
        So let me be and I'll set you free <br>
        I am in misery <br>
        There ain't nobody <br>
        Who can comfort me, oh-yeah <br>
        Why won't you answer me? <br>
        The silence is slowly killing me, oh-yeah <br>
        Girl you really got me bad <br>
        You really got me bad <br>
        Now I'm gonna get you back <br>
        Now I'm gonna get you back, yeah <br>
        You say your faith is shaken <br>
        And you may be mistaken <br>
        You keep me wide awake <br>
        And waiting for the sun <br>
        I'm desperate and confused <br>
        So far away from you <br>
        And I'm getting near <br>
        I don't care where I have to run <br>
        Why do you do <br>
        What you do to me, yeah <br>
        Why won't you answer me <br>
        Answer me, yeah <br>
        Why do you  <br>
        What you do to me, yeah <br>
        Why won't you answer me <br>
        Answer me, yeah <br>
        I am in misery <br>
        There ain't nobody <br>
        Who can comfort me, oh-yeah <br>
        Why won't you answer me? <br>
        The silence is slowly killing me, oh-yeah <br>
        Girl you really got me bad <br>
        You really got me bad <br>
        Now I'm gonna get you back <br>
        Now I'm gonna get you back <br>
        Girl you really got me bad <br>
        You really got me bad <br>
        Now I'm gonna get you back <br>
        I'm gonna get you back <br>
        Girl you really got me bad <br>
        You really got me bad <br>
        Now I'm gonna get you back <br>
        I'm gonna get you back <br>
        Girl you really got me bad <br>
        You really got me bad <br>
        Now I'm gonna get you back <br>
        I'm gonna get you back <br>
